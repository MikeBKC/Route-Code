It might be related to something I did (and was very impressed with as far
as ipset goes): I had defined a /16 range of addresses in that ipset, but
later on had to delete a single address from that range with the ipset -D
command.

When I executed ipset -L (and got the kernel error) I found out that ipset
had readjusted, 'automatically', the IP range, which I found quite good.

For example, let say the original IP range was 10.10.0.0-10.10.255.255. Then
I deleted 10.10.100.100 and issued ipset -L. The previous range of
10.10.0.0-10.10.255.255 is now split in two, 'automatically' by ipset, to
10.10.0.0-10.10.100.99 and 10.10.100.101-10.10.255.255 - quite impressive,
though unfortunate that I get the kernel error, which I suspect was caused
by the deletion I did previously.
