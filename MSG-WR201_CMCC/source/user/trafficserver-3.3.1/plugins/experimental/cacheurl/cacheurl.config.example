# Configuration file format:
#
# url_pattern   cache_key_replacement
#
# The url_pattern is a regular expression (pcre). The replacement can contain
# $1, $2 and so on, which will be replaced with the appropriate matching group
# from the pattern.

# Make files from s1.example.com, s2.example.com and s3.example.com all
# be cached with the same key.
# Adding a unique suffix (TSINTERNAL in this example) to the cache key
# guarantees that it won't clash with a real URL should s.example.com exist.
http://s[123].example.com/(.*)  http://s.example.com.TSINTERNAL/$1

# Cache based on only some parts of a query string (e.g. ignore session
# information). This plucks out the id and format query string variables and
# only considers those when making the cache key.
http://www.example.com/video\?.*?\&?(id=[0-9a-f]*).*?\&(format=[a-z]*) http://video-srv.example.com.ATSINTERNAL/$1&$2

# Completely ignore a query string for a specific page
http://www.example.com/some/page.html(?:\?|$) http://www.example.com/some/page.html
