This plugin allows you to change the key that is used for caching a request.
It is designed so that multiple requests that have different URLs but the same
content (for example, site mirrors) need be cached only once.

Installation:

    make
    sudo make install

If you don't have the traffic server binaries in your path, then you will need
to specify the path to tsxs manually:

    make TSXS=/opt/ts/bin/tsxs
    sudo make TSXS=/opt/ts/bin/tsxs install

Configuration:

    Create a cacheurl.config file in the plugin directory with the url
    patterns to match. See the cacheurl.config.example file for what to put in
    this file.

    Add the plugin to your plugins.conf file: cacheurl.so

Start traffic server. Any rewritten URLs will be written to cacheurl.log in
the log directory by default.
