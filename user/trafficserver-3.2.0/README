Apache Traffic Server

Traffic Server is a high-performance building block for cloud services.
It's more than just a caching proxy server; it also has support for
plugins to build large scale web applications.

2. REQUIREMENTS
    This section outlines different OS distributions

  Fedora 11,12, 13, 14, 15:
    autoconf

  Fedora 8 EC2 (Kernel: 2.6.21.7-2.ec2.v1.2.fc8xen):
    FC8 on EC2 requires unique configure declarations, please see that section
    below.

          automate this or use the pre-built public Fedora Core 8 EC2 AMI 
          with ATS installed. Both of which are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
          See 'README-EC2' for further details.

    Install these packages:

3. Building from distribution

You can download the latest source code from the official Apache Traffic
Server site:

       http://trafficserver.apache.org/downloads.html

(or via the URL shortener: http://s.apache.org/uG). Once downloaded,
follow the instructions:

   tar xf trafficserver-2.1.8-unstable.tar.bz2
   cd trafficserver-2.1.8-unstable
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makfiles
  make                   # execute the compile

This will build with a destination prefix of /usr/local. You can finish
the installation with

  sudo make install


4. BUILDING FROM SVN REPO

  mkdir -p ~/dev         # make yourself a development dir
  cd ~/dev               # enter your development dir
  svn checkout ...       # get the source code from ASF Subversion repo
  cd traffic             # enter the checkout dir
  autoreconf -i          # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makfiles
  make                   # execute the compile

4b. Instructions for building on EC2
    NOTE: Alternately you may use the scripts under 'contrib' which will 
          automate the install for trafficserver under EC2 which is 
          HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. See 'README-EC2' for further details.

   # As root do the following when using Ubuntu
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   svn checkout ...       # get the source code from ASF Subversion repo
   cd traffic             # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure
   make

   # As root do the following when using Fedora Core 8 kernel
   mkdir -p /mnt          #EC2 Storage Mount, where storage is located
   cd /mnt
   svn checkout ...       # get the source code from ASF Subversion repo
   cd traffic             # enter the checkout dir
   autoreconf -i --force  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
   ./configure --disable-eventfd
   make
