Review comments on man pages
-----------------------------
1. No extra blank lines specified on any section.
2. Formatting of the synopsis section should be consistent with
   a. <command name> -help
   b. cli_detailed_command_list.txt
   c. Man page section.

3. Only options sections should be present. All operand section should be moved to options section.

   3.a. Any missing Option section should be listed in the section.
       (Look in the spec and the example listed in the man page to fill up the option section.)

4. Execute the command and see if it is consistent. File a DDTS bug if the command does not work fine as the detailed_spec.

5. All example section should be aligned correctly.
   Use the following formats to achieve this option.
   a. Change All .TP command to .PP (For paragraphs.)
   b. For example use .PP followed by .fi

6. Prompt to be replaced to traffic_shell>

7. All commands should return either +OK or -ERROR after execution.
