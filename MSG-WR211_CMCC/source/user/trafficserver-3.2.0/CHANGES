   remap.config.

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.9
  *) [TS-805] HostDB wastes a lot of storage for round-robin entries,
   and the calculations of size are off.

  *) [TS-806] TS_ADDTO removes duplicates, so avoid this by using the
   -R option to libtool

  *) [TS-793] Improve print statements for ink_freelist debugging.

  *) [TS-679] The external API was changed to make it IPv6 compliant
     (although it doesn't actually work with IPv6). Old API functions
     were deprecated but not removed.

  *) [TS-797] Wrong delete used in stats processor.

  *) [TS-769] Fixed infinite loop when getting a 505 response from the
   origin and the connection is keep-alive.  Now downgrading keep-alive
   all the time along with the protocol.

  *) [TS-788] Cleaned up the request and response cacheable apis.

  *) [TS-792] Add a config option (disabled by default) to support
  mlock() and mlockall().

  *) [TS-783] Port ATS to IA64. Author: Arno Toell.

  *) [TS-778] Compile Fails on Solaris 10 (gcc). Author: Igor Brezac.

  *) [TS-404] Add a new API, TSOSIpSet() which allows you to bypass the
    origin server DNS lookup.

  *) [TS-791] Remove ShmemClean.cc, it's no longer needed.

  *) [TS-786] Add a perl module to edit a records.config configuration
  file.

  *) [TS-779] Set thread name for various event types.

  *) [TS-784] Don not use class allocator for remap processing when no
   remap threads are enabled.

  *) [TS-782] Remap processor creates a remap thread even when asked not
   to.

  *) [TS-781] Cleanup of unusual configs, and better defaults making
   records.config leaner, and a little more useful.

  *) [TS-780] Retune the number of SSL threads.

  *) [TS-775] Disable cluster autodiscovery via multicast when
   clustering is disabled. This should hopefully fix run-time errors
   with Ubuntu 11.x.

  *) [TS-776] memchr in glibc has evolved, and is faster than our
   version, replaced.

  *) [TS-774] Add a new configure option, --enable-static-libts, which
   avoids the dynamic linking hassles involved with the dynamic nature
   of libts. This is for devs only.

  *) [TS-773] Traffic server has a hard limit of 512 gigabytes per RAW
   disk partition. This fix required changing the disk structure which
   will result in a total disk cache clear (wipe) after upgrading.

  *) [TS-772] Make proxy.config.http.doc_in_cache_skip_dns overridable.

  *) [TS-770] proxy.config.http.doc_in_cache_skip_dns is not being read
   from records.config. Author: Yakov Markovitch

  *) [TS-738] 'make check` fails on x86.

  *) [TS-771] Remove remaining v1 log buffer code.

  *) [TS-562] Make --with-openssl path be honored with an -rpath to
   libtool. This also fixes the same problem with other libraries,
   e.g. pcre, zlib etc.

  *) [TS-765] Make the backdoor port (8084 by default) only listen on
   127.0.0.1 .

  *) [TS-762] Range values like -10 are processed. Author: William
   Bardwell.

  *) [TS-761] Fixed bug where 3 (or more) remap plugins in a chain
   couldn't be loaded.

  *) [TS-763] When creating multiple SSL accept threads, we use the
   wrong instantiator.

  *) [TS-757] Change TSNetAccept() API to take an option for enabling
    (and number of) accept threads.

  *) [TS-759] Makefile in proxy/config handles $DESTDIR incorrectly.
   Author: Arno Toell

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.8
  *) [TS-750] TS does not fail-over if one origin server for a 2 address
   hostname. Author: William Bardwell.

  *) [TS-752] If you cancel a scan really quickly you can get a NULL
  dereference. Also other important performance and correctness fixes
  for the cache scanning code. Author: William Bardwell and jplevyak.

  *) [TS-749] Connection hangs if origin server goes down in the middle of
  a response. Author: William Bardwell.

  *) [TS-753] TS-753 Some more cleanup in InkAPI, move a few experimental
   APIs to ts.h

  *) [TS-751] Experimental TSHttpTxnCacheLookupStatusSet(HIT_STALE) calls
   cause a crash. Author: William Bardwell

  *) [TS-748] Client side transparency doesn't work on trunk.

  *) [TS-702] FATAL: MIME.cc:1250: failed assert `j < block_count`.
  Author: Yakov Markovitch

  *) [TS-746] Allow to remove URL fields with "NULL" (or 0) values.

  *) [TS-744] Configurations to control SSL session reuse and cache
  size. Authors: qianshi and Leif

  *) [TS-716] Bug where NetVC could be double free'd.
   Fix for DNS crash: bad memory management of HostEnt structures. It is
   not clear that this fixes the bug entirely.  Some of the stack traces
   are consistent with this bug, but some are not.

  *) [TS-743] Support separate configs for keep-alive enabled for _in
   and _out connections.

  *) [TS-741] traffic_manager handles sockets incorrectly.

  *) [TS-742] assert triggered wrongly (in debug builds).

  *) [TS-740] Traffic Server fails to build on kfreebsd.
   Author: Arno Toell.

  *) [TS-737] Small hackish fix for rc/trafficserver.in so rc/trafficserver
   will work with FreeBSD. Author: G Todd.

  *) [TS-735] Disable ccache by default, use with --enable-ccache.

  *) [TS-734] Remove unused fields in net stats pages.

  *) [TS-212] Startup service support for Solaris. Author: Igor Brezac.

  *) [TS-629] fix some non-portable char == unsigned char assumptions.

  *) [TS-621] Update records.config.default.in with changed / removed
   configs.

  *) [TS-641] Remove a bunch of Web UI related configs and code.

  *) [TS-719] libtsutil.so is not self-contained.
  Author: Igor Brezac.

  *) [TS-729] Fix bugs with Via Headers handling. (Note: This is
   unlikely to have caused the crash the bug report)
   Author Leif Hedstrom

  *) [TS-721] Incorrect http hit ratio in stats.
   This also removes a number of obsoleted stats and also disables
   stats aggregation in WebOverview.cc, one more nail to WebUI's
   grave. Author: Leif Hedstrom

  *) [TS-728] Remove the --enable-webui option, since it doesn't
   produce a running webui anyway. Also remove html2

  *) [TS-685] Rename partition.config because it doesn't have
   anything todo with disks. Also rename all code related to it
   so as not to confuse anybody.

  *) [TS-714] Fix traffic_shell hanging on every command

  *) [TS-562] Fix TCL linking to honor custom library dirs.
   Author: Eric Connell.

  *) [TS-624] make install should not overwrite etc/trafficserver/.
   Author: Eric Connell.

  *) [TS-465] Allow for existing Server: string to not be overwritten.
   This adds a new semantic for the value "2" to this option.

  *) [TS-633] Fix reverse mapping with different schemes.
   Author: Andreas Hartke.

  *) [TS-715] Fixes and cleanup for Perl client. Author: Billy Vierra.

  *) TS-550 Remove an unused / unsupported debug tool. Also update the
   remap code to use our standard linked list (Queue in this case).

  *) [TS-704] Link traffic_server dynamically to make distros happy,
  since --disable-static will work.

  *) [TS-545] Clean out more cruft from MIXT legacy.

  *) [TS-713] Honor the offset within do_io_pread.

  *) [TS-712] Fix compile problems with clang / llvm

  *) [TS-545] parent.config (and perhaps other configs) have an unused
   concept of "tags" for MIXT media. Cleanup remaining MIXT junk.

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.7
  *) [TS-711] Don't schedule remap.config reloads on a network threads.
   We now schedule this task on an ET_TASK thread, which avoids blocking
   a net-thread for several seconds (when reloading very large remaps).

  *) [TS-710] Do not dlopen / reload a remap plugin .so more than once.

  *) [TS-588] Change Remap plugin APIs to use URL TSMLoc, and normal
   ts/ts.h APIs for getting and setting components.

  *) [TS-708] TsConfig doesn't handle backslashes correctly.

  *) [TS-209] add support for raw disk on Solaris: credits: Igor Brezac
    for both the code and testing!

  *) [TS-705] Fixes for compiling with gcc v4.6.

  *) [TS-706] hardware sector size's over 8K current report an Error
   but are passed through resulting in lots of disk waste.

  *) [TS-707] The random number generator from 1-23-2011 is using the
   same seed for all threads = collisions in the cache

  *) [TS-700] Need additional controls in cache.config.

  *) [TS-696] make check fails on libtsutil due to missing libresolv
   and librt. Author: Eric Connell.

  *) [TS-691] LogFilter not working for "int" types.
   Author: Eric Connell.

  *) [TS-692] Add an experimental API to modify the outgoing IP address.

  *) TS-676: logic in Store::clear and Store::read_config is wrong.
  Author: mohan_zl.

  *) [TS-680] Change many typedef void* types to anonymous structs.

  *) [TS-690] Schedule some callbacks on the ET_TASK threads

  *) TS-689 Restore TSMgmtUpdateRegister() to the SDK APIs.

  *) [TS-550] Remove MgmtPlugin.{cc,h}.

  *) [TS-657] Proper validation of RWW settings on startup.

  *) [TS-688] Remove the "tag" modifier from parent.config.

  *) [TS-682] Segfault when partition.config is used.

  *) [TS-687] Build failures on FreeBSD8

  *) [TS-684] config.layout for gentoo linux, may also be used on Fedora

  *) [TS-675] Make redirect and reverse maps work again.

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.6

  *) [TS-678] Add a config option for try-lock retry delay.

   This adds a configuration option

         proxy.config.cache.mutex_retry_delay INT 2

   2ms seems to be fairly optimal, with little detrimental effect on CPU
   usage. We'll fine tune this further in the next release.

  *) [TS-674] Fixes for cache.config and the "modifiers" to work.

  *) [TS-641] Remove inktomi*.css and some files only referenced by it.
   Removing mgmt/html2/charting. Remove the now empty mgmt/html2/tune.

  *) [TS-590] Cleanup all SDK APIs to be more consistent. This changes a
   large number of APIs, so please check updated docs and signatures in
   ts/ts.h. A new tools, tools/apichecker.pl, can be used to help
   identifying areas in existing plugins that might need changes.

  *) [TS-673] Make the default configurations more conservative
   for when content is cacheable.

  *) [TS-672] Remove unused/unreferenced Win32 header files and
   code paths

  *) [TS-671] Detect install group based on install user.

  *) [TS-644] Fix clustered cache pages crash.

  *) [TS-651] Clear all stats when we ask to clear the local stats.

  *) [TS-489] Remove the "connection collapsing" feature, it was poorly
   implemented, and caused major problem if enabled. We should redo this
   for v3.1 in a way that fits with the HttpSM [author: mohan_zl].

  *) [TS-668] Add support for URL stats to traffic_logstats.

  *) [TS-665] Remove HTTP_ASSERT from the code base, use standard asserts.

  *) [TS-663, TS-664] Fixes to WCCP with mask assignments, and trunk build
   problems.

  *) [TS-662] Make per partition stats for bytes_used work.

  *) [TS-661] Delay the copy of per transaction configs until a plugin
   actually tries to modify a setting. We also add these settings to the
   list of configurations that is overridable:

       proxy.config.http.cache.max_open_read_retries
       proxy.config.http.cache.open_read_retry_time

  *) [TS-660] Cache scan can not be canceled.

  *) [TS-505, TS-506] Changed the defaults to deal with read contention on
   the cache, this dramatically improves the performance on cache misses.

  *) [TS-655] Reorganize some code to reduce binary foot prints.

  *) [TS-653] Bogus logcat conversion of squid timestamps.

  *) [TS-643] Unable to purge objects on other servers in full cluster mode.

  *) New 64-bit random generator.

  *) [TS-639] Rename the management APIs from INK* to TS*.

  *) [TS-650] Remove the dead v2 stats code.

  *) [TS-649] Dynamic libraries for mgmt APIs.

    This makes libts -> libtsutil, and we now support making .so's for
    libtsutil.so and libtsmgmt.so. All binaries are changed to use this,
    except traffic_server which continues to use the libtsutil.a library
    (for performance on e.g. 32-bit platforms).

    This also renames the public API include file to be

         #include <ts/mgmtapi.h>

  *) [TS-647] Move Layout out of iocore and into lib/ts.

  *) [TS-638] Rename various directories:
      proxy/mgmt -> mgmt/
      proxy/mgmt/cop -> cop/

   All "cli" APIs are now also migrated into mgmt/cli, unified into one
   single cli.

  *) [TS-641] Cleanup of Web2/HTML2.

  *) [TS-636, TS-637] Remove various unused source files.

  *) [TS-631] Rename proxy/http2 -> proxy/http and proxy/mgmt2 to proxy/mgmt.

  *) [TS-582] Add an example to records.config for how to bind a specific IP.

  *) [TS-491] Cluster port was activated even with clustering disabled. This fix also
   adds monitoring support for the "cli" unix domain socket.

  *) [TS-593] Cleanup of inktomi.com.

  *) [TS-324] Cleaning up some old TCL files and dependencies.

  *) Remove traces of FTP references [TS-324] by purging the now useless TCL
  bindings to it.

  *) [TS-513] Fix configure issues for sqlite3. This fix eliminates all of
  SimpleDBM, sqlite3 and bdb dependencies. It also fixes the "make
  distclean" problem, and clean things up a bit.

  *) [TS-491] Add the CLI interface to Traffic Cop, and make it possible to
   run traffic_manager without listening on the cluster port.

  *) [TS-583] Build fails if --disable-webui is added.

  *) [TS-618] Removing traces of CCAS/CCASFLAGS.

  *) [TS-627] Fixes for "make check" to succeed (author: Arno Toell).

  *) [TS-632] Fixes for bad cast and cleanup for Intel CC.

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.5

  *) More 64-bit issues has been identified in the SDK and HTTP core, and
  fixed [TS-620].

  *) Code cleanup of old transparency code and options [TS-613].

  *) We now require a compiler (or libc) that provides atomic
  operations. This includes gcc 4.1.2 or later, Intel CC, clang (recent
  versions) as well as Sun's Solaris compilers and libc [TS-618].

  *) Support normal default path for remap plugins [TS-616].

  *) Change default settings for MSIE User-Agent sniffing [TS-615].

  *) Remove remnants from InktoSwitch. This removes the following
  configurations [TS-614]:

      proxy.config.http.inktoswitch_enabled
      proxy.config.http.router_ip
      proxy.config.http.router_port

  *) Modify TSContSchedule to take a thread type, and add
  TSContScheduleEvery [TS-589].

  *) Added support to allow some select (~50 or so) records.config
  configurations to be overridable per transaction. This is done via new SDK
  APIs, as well as a remap plugin provided with the core [TS-599]. The new
  APIs available are

      TSHttpTxnConfigIntSet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigIntGet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigFloatSet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigFloatGet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigStringSet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigStringGet()
      TSHttpTxnConfigFind()

  *) Eliminate dedicated default DNS for SplitDNS [TS-597]. Author: Zhao
   Yongming.

  *) Eliminate proxy.config.net.max_poll_delay configs [TS-605].

  *) Old traffic_net configurations are eliminated [TS-601].

  *) Multiple preads: this patch is only active if you call do_io_pread on
  the cache.  This includes a regression test for do_io_pread which is at
  least a smoke test of the new code. [TS-61]

  *) Migrate from home-grown regular expression classes to pcre [TS-604]

  *) Reduce number of calls to regex matcher for standard requests with
   well-known-strings (WKS). [TS-603]

  *) Parse Range: requests a bit better. Prior, a request like like Range:
   bytes=100-200 would return 0-200. Additionally, Range: bytes=100- would
   not parse properly. [TS-596]

  *) Remove old, unused configuration code (duplicated) [TS-576].

  *) Bump the SDK version numbers properly [TS-595].

  *) Migrate from our own int64 (et.al) to int64_t / stdint types. This also
   changes the SDK, so ts/ts.h users should now use int64_t etc. [TS-594].

  *)./configure will now tell us more about its defaults.

  *) Add better tests for eventfd, making sure sys/eventfd.h exists
   [TS-515].

  *) Stub / base implementation for the Task thread pool [TS-589].

  *) Cleanup of traffic_logstats, and also add support for JSON
   output. Several new options and query args added to select output format
   and data [TS-587].

  *) Add back support for using the default DNSHandler from DNS.cc This
   helps with SplitDNS [TS-580].

  *) Fixes for DNS to properly schedule and initialize [TS-570].

  *) Fix make check so it actually compiles [TS-586].

  *) Remove RAF pieces [TS-584].

  *) Replace the SDKAllocator with a ClassAllocator [TS-577].

     This reduces the amount of memory allocation for plugins, but requires
     that plugins now religiously release the handles that they are expected
     to release (i.e. no automatic gc is done for lazy developers).

  *) Fixes for getting the altinfo regression check to succeeds [TS-171].

  *) Fixes for some transform, and other, mismatches of int vs int64 in the
   new APIs and underlying cache [TS-456].

  *) Eliminate misguided string copies in the SDK [TS-579].

  *) Fix build of ts.h and tsxs when the .in files changes [TS-574].

  *) Move libinktomi++ and librecords to lib/ts and lib/records [TS-571].

  *) Add SDK API calls to directly get the elements of the running TS
   version [TS-568].

  *) Added WCCP support.

  *) Bring IPv6 functionality back to trunk, for incoming (client)
   connections [TS-18]. Original author: Tsunayoshi Egawa.

  *) Segfault with HTTPS, fixed by correctly initializing SSLNetVConnection
   being added to freelist [TS-559].

  *) The old logs.config custom log format is no longer supported. Only the
   XML custom logs are now supported. This eliminates the config

       proxy.config.log.xml_logs_config

   as well, since it's the only option for custom logs [TS-556].

  *) All log configurations (and stats) are renamed from log2.* to
   log.*. This is to avoid confusion, since Apache Traffic Server never had
   the old (obsolete) log system. There's now only one log system, log
   [TS-555].

  *) Many fixes and improvements on the Stats pages subsystem. This now
   properly supports (if configured) various internal URLs, like
   http://{net}, http://{hostdb} etc. [TS-554].

  *) The NewCacheVC is removed [TS-551].

  *) Support for the Alpha processor is eliminated [TS-552].

  *) A number of unecessary memory allocations are removed, improving
   performance under heavy load. [TS-550, TS-549]

  *) All streaming media (MIXT) configurations are now properly removed from
   code and default configs [TS-544].

  *) URL scheme was case sensitive in the cache key [TS-474].

  *) Fixes for broken API signatures, additions / modifications to the
   following API:

     TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnArgSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, int arg_idx, void *arg);
     TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnArgGet(TSHttpTxn txnp, int arg_idx, void **argp);
     TSReturnCode TSHttpSsnArgSet(TSHttpSsn ssnp, int arg_idx, void *arg);
     TSReturnCode TSHttpSsnArgGet(TSHttpSsn ssnp, int arg_idx, void **argp);

     TSReturnCode TSHttpArgIndexReserve(const char* name, const char*
     description, int* arg_idx); TSReturnCode TSHttpArgIndexNameLookup(const
     char* name, int* arg_idx, const char** description); TSReturnCode
     TSHttpArgIndexLookup(int arg_idx, const char** name, const char**
     description);

     TSReturnCode TSHttpSsnTransactionCount(TSHttpSsn ssnp, int* count);

   This was all combine into [TS-504], but also see [TS-503].

  *) Many fixes for broken regression tests!

  *) RNI is now completely cleaned out [TS-536].

  *) Fixes for SplitDNS (co-author: mohan_zl) [TS-435].

  *) HTTPS to origin servers, with Chunked responses, would hang [TS-540].

  *) Mismatched APIs using "unsigned char*" [TS-458].

  *) Rename / modify TSSetCacheUrl() API, the new prototype is

     TSReturnCode TSCacheUrlSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, const char *url, int
     length);

   If length == -1, then the API will calculate it using strlen() [TS-520].

  *) All public APIs, structs and defines are now prefixed with "TS" instead
   of the old "INK". There are two exceptions, for the deprecated INKStats*
   and INKCoupledStats* APIs [TS-521].

  *) The hooks around "remap" has been organized, and a new hook as been
   added (for post-remap). New / renamed hooks are

     TS_HTTP_PRE_REMAP_HOOK TS_HTTP_POST_REMAP_HOOK

   In addition, a new API was added, to allow a plugin to skip the remap
   phase completely:

     TSReturnCode TSSkipRemappingSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, int flag);

   These fixes went in with [TS-529] and [TS-530].

  *) INKHttpTxnSetHttpRetStatus not honored when an API transaction is
   reenabled with INK_EVENT_HTTP_ERROR [TS-535].

  *) Various defines for version identification has been moved to the public
   ts/ts.h include file, e.g.

       #define TS_VERSION_STRING             "2.1.6-unstable"
       #define TS_VERSION_NUMBER              2001006
       #define TS_VERSION_MAJOR               2
       #define TS_VERSION_MINOR               1
       #define TS_VERSION_MICRO               6

   The intended use is for plugins to be able to verify available APIs at
   compile time (vs the existing runtime checks) [TS-534].

  *) Traffic Server should now build on ARM processors. Commit message is
   appropriately describing the situation with this CPU:

   This is a sad day of defeat.  Not my defeat, but more a collective human
   defeat.

   Question: "Chips fabricated today don't have 64bit atomic primitives?"
   Answer: "Be sad."

   The ARM box we're working on (armv5tejl) doesn't support any 64bit
   primitives.

   This means we need a method of using a global (yes, giant lock of death)
   to protect modifications of arbitrary 64bit integers in process space.
   We could make this less contentious by allocating pagesize/8 mutexs and
   then protecting an int64 based on its page offset.  Instead, I think we
   should mobilize to burn these architectures to the ground and use public
   embarrassment to fix future instruction sets. If another platform has
   this issue, we'll want to change the define to:

   TS_ARCHITECTURE_LACKS_64BIT_INSTRUCTIONS and turn on the global death
   lock based on that.

   This does not change performance on any other platform -- it's compile
   time capital punishment. [TS-533] and [TS-135].

  *) Very old APIs, that have been deprecated since long before the Apache
   Open Source project, are removed. Also, only three public include files
   are now available:

     ts/ts.h ts/experimental.h ts/remap.h

  Various other cleanup related to the APIs was also done [TS-522].

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.4

  *) Fixes to clustering, that caused an assert to trigger after the stats
   changes [TS-519].

  *) Make the checks when to honor the Content-Length: header less strict,
   against origins without Keep-Alive [TS-500].

  *) Eliminate old ssl_ports feature, it's completely replaced with the
   connect_ports configuration [TS-517].

  *) New script available to help build plugins, tsxs [TS-512].

  *) Simple, brute force (and efficient) status code stats counters
   [TS-509].

  *) Generalize RecDumpRecordsHt to use RecDumpRecords which is a
   callback/map pattern [TS-508].

  *) Fix plugin APIs to be compatible with the 64-bit changes in the
   core. This is an incompatible change with previous releases [TS-14].

  *) Fixes for stats around origin connection counters, used when allowing
   for origin connections to be reused between clients [TS-501].

  *) Experimental supoprt for a dedicated DNS thread. This can be enabled
   with the records.config option

      CONFIG proxy.config.dns.dedicated_thread INT 1

  This feature is possibly useful for very busy forward or transparent
  proxies [TS-307].

  *) Accept threads can leak some amount of memory. This patch also supports
   multiple accept threads (very experimental!) [TS-496].

  *) HttpSM has an assertion that checks the client URL against the cache
   URL, which breaks INKSetCacheUrl [TS-495].

  *) Return value from pcre_exec tested incorrectly [TS-493].

  *) Improved loop detection using the Via header [TS-490].

  *) Fixes for Solaris build (yay, it builds!).

  *) Remove filter.config remnants [TS-486].

  *) Cleanup in InkAPI [TS-485].

  *) Move PKGSYSUSER to ink_config.h.in [TS-482].

  *) Unresponsive server can stall ATS [TS-480].

  *) UrlRewrite cleanup [TS-434].

  *) Build TS with clang (author: Igor Galic) [TS-427].

  *) Better support and handling of DNS round-robin options (author: Zhao
   Yongming) [TS-313].

  *) Make it possible to "write" Content-Length headers > 2GB [TS-471].

  *) Better support for Age: headers, and avoiding overflows [TS-470].

  *) Added a configure option to size the API stats "slots". The new option
  is --with-max-api-stats=<n> [TS-454].

  *) In Cache.cc, make snprintf() around Debug statements conditional for
   performance [TS-459].

  *) Cleanup / optimize Via: string generation [TS-460]. Also make the
   default for Via: on responses to be disabled (it can leak info).

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.3

  *) Removed the remnants of NCA from the source [TS-455].

  *) New plugin APIs for stats, and making the "v2" (incomplete) stats
  experimental (no longer built by default) [TS-390]. See
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/NewStatsAPI for more
  details.

   new standard). Autodetected for raw devices on Linux (no support for
   other OSes yet), and added a new configuration

       CONFIG proxy.config.cache.force_sector_size INT 4096

   This change invalidates the entire cache as well, since it's no longer
   compatible [TS-43].

  *) Added APIs to override the cacheablity of the response [TS-395].

  *) Add OSX support to 'trafficserver' script (author: Dan Mercer)
   [TS-210].

  *) Update so the pristine URL will work for reverse and forward proxy.
    Also, clearing the url on transaction close (author: Wendy Huang)
    [TS-410].

  *) TS fails to use user ID with user name > 8 characters (author: Yakov
   Markovitch) [TS-420].

  *) Improvements in resilience against DNS poisoning and forging of
   response packets [TS-425] and [CVE-2010-2952].

  *) Segmentation fault in INKError when error output is made both in error
   log and as debug messages (author: Yakov Markovitch) [TS-419].

  *) Debian layout for config.layout (author: Igor Galic) [TS-415].

  *) Eliminate extraneous stats thread [TS-411].

  *) CACHE_FRAG_TYPE is now not a power of 2 [TS-76].

  *) Segfault when using show:network [TS-109].

  *) Update all examples to use non-deprecated APIs [TS-266].

  *) Do some cleanup on Connection::fast_connect and
   Connection::bind_connect (author: Alan M. Carrol) [TS-320].

  *) Remove LLONG config option [Ts-364].

  *) Cleanup some proxy/mgmt2/tools [TS-16].

  *) Cleanup a little more of webui [TS-91].

  *) TCL missing [TS-326].

  *) logstats does not work with layout changes (author: Zhao Yongming)
   [TS-385].

  *) Convert bogus IOCORE_MachineFatal and IOCORE_ProcessFatal to Warning
    and MachineFatal respectively based on review of the code and related
    uses [TS-144].

  *) INKIOBufferReaderCopy, INKIOBufferWrite should take void * instead of
   char * [TS-67].

  *) Adds APIs for aio disk read and writes using the internal aio support
    in iocore (author: Wendy Huang) [TS-387].

  *) Standardize configure options by allowing to specify the location for
    any third-party library, and split library detection code into separate
    .m4 files [TS-345].

  *) Reorganization of the path layout system.  Add --enable-layout=LAYOUT
    configure option that can select layout from config.layout file
    [TS-280].

  *) HTTP state machine is now 64-bit "clean", allowing for caching and
   proxying documents larger than 2GB [TS-34].

  *) Fix for truncated Content-Type on TS-generated responses [TS-290].

  *) Performance improvements on cache for larger(ish) objects.

Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.0

  *) Support for many more platforms, including FreeBSD, MacOSX and Solaris.

  *) Code cleanup to get the ATS software into a distributable shape. This
   means that certain things are missing, or not functional (intentionally).

  *) Support for larger Cache Partitions up to .5 PB (Petabytes), reducing
   seeks/write.

  *) Reduced Cache miss latency (sub millesecond).

  *) RAM Cache pluggability, new algorithm (CLFUS) and optional compression.
